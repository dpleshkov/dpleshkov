**Hi there! I'm @dpleshkov, also known as @dankdmitron.**

I'm a mostly self-taught programmer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. You may know me for [ServerList+](https://github.com/dpleshkov/serverlistplus-client), a website offering a detailed list of active lobbies and players in Starblast.io.

This GitHub page contains a variety of other code I've written and made public â€” feel free to take a look!
